## 1. Introduction
### Business Problem
Airbnb is becoming a serious business in recent years. Other than individual hosts who share their own places, companies around the world also step in thisa new business. Reports showed that about 2 million people stay in Airbnb rentals across the world during an average night in 2018. In this project, we want to find out what is the best place to host an Airbnb in Manhattan, New York. Furthermore, we are also interested in the patterns behind those bestsellers. We can implement those patterns in other cities afterward.
